        <h2>Steps to Make Herbivore Hustle Pizza</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 425°F (220°C). If using a pizza stone or baking sheet, place it in the oven to heat up.</li>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine self-rising flour and Greek yogurt. Mix until a dough forms, then knead on a floured surface for 2–3 minutes until smooth.</li>
            <li>Shape the dough into a ball or oval about 1/4 inch thick. For a crispier crust, make it slightly thinner.</li>
            <li>Transfer the dough onto parchment paper to easily move it onto the hot baking sheet or stone.</li>
            <li>Spread the pizza sauce over the dough. Add cottage cheese, mozzarella, ricotta (if using), and your favorite toppings.</li>
            <li>Bake for 12–15 minutes until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is melted and lightly browned.</li>
            <li>Let cool slightly, then slice and serve. Too Goated Gainz unlocked!! 💪🔥</li>
