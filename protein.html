        <h2>Steps to Make Protein Power Pizza</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Set the oven rack to the lower position and preheat the oven to 500°F.</li>
            <li>If using refrigerated dough, allow it to sit at room temperature for 30 minutes before shaping.</li>
            <li>Prepare your toppings: cook the bacon and sausage, shred the cheeses, and measure out the remaining ingredients.</li>
            <li>On a lightly floured surface, stretch and shape the dough into a 10-inch circle. Transfer to a baking sheet and press into a 12-inch circle, leaving the edges slightly thicker.</li>
            <li>Brush olive oil along the crust edges for a crispier finish.</li>
            <li>Spread the pizza sauce evenly over the dough, add mozzarella, parmesan, pepperoni, bacon, Canadian bacon, and sausage, then sprinkle Italian seasoning and red pepper flakes if desired.</li>
            <li>Bake for 10–13 minutes until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
            <li>Slice immediately and serve hot. Massive Gainz unlocked 💪🔥</li>
