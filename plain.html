<!-- general project guidelines:

- create a home page of some restaurant either modelled after a place in berkeley or something from your imagination
- from the home page link to at least two other webpages that each have a recipe for an item.

Your recipe page should have the following content:
- A free image of the finished dish under the h1 heading that you added earlier.
- Under the image, it should have an appropriately sized “Description” heading followed by a paragraph or two describing the recipe.
- Under the description, add an “Ingredients” heading followed by an unordered list of the ingredients needed for the recipe.
- Finally, under the ingredients list, add a “Steps” heading followed by an ordered list of the steps needed for making the dish.

Or not idk thats just a general guideline, to have some experimentation with html and css. 
- Make sure you can navigate to any page from any original page-->
